      Just a foolish attempt to fix Safari 3rd-party cookies issue. The issue arises when
      an Advocate who never visited talkable.com domain sees Talkable campaign integrated on
      a customer's website (example.com). Safari (when certain security policy is set,
      btw it is set by default like that) will Talkable's attempt to set cookies on
      https://talkable.com domain, even though a cookie is set from within of an iframe.
      
      As a fix we will:
      1. Pass "current visitor UUID" right from our integration library as an iframe
         URL param. The UUID will be stored in cookies on customer's website (example.com).
         Presumably we won't have any troubles setting this cookie since the integration
         lib is a part of a customer's page.

         1.1 If a Friend is coming from Talkable with "visitor_uuid" URL param we will need
             to take that UUID rather than the one which was already set in cookies. It
             then allows the Friend to see the Gleam campaign, rather than seeing a
             Trigger Widget.
    
         1.2 In a scenario where AD saw the FW campaign with the UUID params passed in
             through URL params and then saw FR Claim Page where a cookie was successfully
             set to talkable.com domain we will need to resolve the conflict of cookies
             because now there are two different cookies set: on example.com and
             on talakble.com. Ideally we want to take the new UUID which was set on the FR
             Claim Page.

      2. Detect that the UUID is not set inside cookies on talkable.com domain (inside iframe)
         and trigger the integration library method to set the cookie there, on a customer's
         website, and then pass it through URL params (see #1).
